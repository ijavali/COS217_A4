Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

The assignment was helpful because I learned a lot about modularity
and recursive methods. I particularly enjoyed the 2nd part of the assignment
because I had to determine which built-in methods I could use, and which
ones I had to basically reconstruct for my checker. However,
I honestly thought that part 1 did nothing to help me learn debugging,
and it felt like I had wasted time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

The assignment was not fun, but I felt that it improved my overall
understanding of pointers, memory allocation, and management in C.
I also finally learned how to use gdb. The assignment was very tedious.

is adherent to the principles of good modular coding.

  For lines 124 and 150, ulChildID is definitely defined because 
  the if statement is entered, meaning that hasChild worked and a
   value has been passed into &ulChildID.

  Otherwise, all of these errors result from our abstract encapsulation of code,
  meaning that different modules can't access the implementations of methods 
  from others. This is adherent to the principles of good modular coding.

  ft.c: line 57: medium priority:
  Function names should be prefixed with module names;
  function name Path_freeString does not match module name ft.c

  Since we cannot edit path.c and path.h, we agreed that it would
  be optimal to include this method outside of those modules as a 
  static method, so long as we gave it the proper method header,
  beginning with Path_.

  For each of these methods, the large chunk of space
  that doesn't have associated comments is used for iStatus checks,
  and each check is abundantly clear.

For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1        BDT_insert
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2        BDT_freeSubtree
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3        BDT_newNode (BDT_addChild doesn't link child to parent)
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad4        BDT_strlenAccumulate
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad5        BDT_findNode
===============================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?

The usage of global variables in dtGood is not representative of
effective encapsulation in modular coding, since those global variables are 
accessed throughout multiple methods within dtGood. While functional, DT_traversePath 
and DT_insert appear cumbersome and bloated. However, due to internal comments, 
they are still clear in their purpose, and each step in their
iterated loops is logical. bIsInitialized could be renamed to bTreeIsInitialized
for clarity, and oNCurr and oNChild used in DT_traversePath are unclear variable names. ulCount could
also be renamed to ulNumNodes, for further clarity, and oNFirstNew is named poorly in DT_insert.

The code succeeds in that it is consistent - each function is named with Node or
DT as a prefix, and each function name is abundantly representative of what it does. 
Exceptions are BDT_strlenAccumulate and BDT_strcatAccumulate, which were named vaguely.
Furthermore, the distribution of resource management between the client and dtGood
is effective because dtGood allocates and frees the string representation
of the tree as well as internal node/path creation/destruction,
whereas the client allocates and frees the entire directory tree. We 
also believe that the interface is relatively concise - all the .h functions
and helper functions have a clear reason for existing. While DT_contains
and DT_findNode seem a bit redundant in functionality, DT_findNode requires a dummy variable
to pass in a found node, so only using DT_findNode when checking if a directory tree
contains a node would not only be confusing in meaning, but would also clutter up a caller
method with more dummy variables. After the implementation of our checkerDT.c, 
the error checking between the client and our checker is sufficient.

The code also establishes contracts in that it is commented very clearly, with
each parameter of each method having a clear meaning. Both the dt and nodeDT
files have strong cohesion because each method is relevant only to the entire tree
or individual nodes, respectively. Finally, the code is weakly coupled among
modules because Node methods are only called in DT during traversals and freeing,
which all require using a method involving a singular, individual node. This 
is a good thing because errors in, for example, nodeDT won't amplify as much in DT. 
It is also easier to maintain, because mistakes between files can be traced back
to just a few cross-module method calls.
